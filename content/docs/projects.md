- [Community Archive](https://github.com/TheExGenesis/community-archive) - The goals of this project are (1) create a public domain dataset so that we can analyze & build apps on top of our own data, commercial or otherwise (2) develop an open workflow for archival that people can self host or create private archives for their communities if they wish.
- [The Hypertext Collective](https://hypertextcollective.com) - A collective of artists, writers, and creators who are exploring the possibilities of hypertext.
- [The TPOT Wiki](/) - recursion, but make it a wiki.
